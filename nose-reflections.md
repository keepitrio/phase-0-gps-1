**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was struggling with keeping my remote and local repos up to date. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Fetching and merging so that the other person working in the repo can get the changes in their local branch.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
1. Does a check in consist of just asking how the person is doing or also asking about how they'd like to go about the pair programming (do you like to be driver or navigator, what is your style or working with somebody else)?
2. When you want to upload a file (image), can you upload directly on GitHub, or should you do it through your terminal? 

**What still confuses you about Git?**
At this point, there isn't much that confuses me, it's more about getting used to the flow and remembering everything I need to do.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was a great learning experience. Ashley and I worked really well together and Shawn was there to give us tips and tricks and get us on track when we were lost. 

We learned that you can use a relative path to add images into a markdown file instead of using a URL, this allows the file to load faster since it doesn't have to go to GitHub to fetch the image.
