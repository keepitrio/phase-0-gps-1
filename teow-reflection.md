How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It went smoother than I expected. To be honest, I went over the exercise briefly before the session started and thought I was ready but not 100% ready? But Rio and Shawn definitely helped fill in the blanks. The way we walked through each step out loud slowly was really helpful in making sure we didn't miss any steps.
